  "readme": "# Cloudflare MCP Server\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is a [new, standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. In this repository, you can find several MCP servers allowing you to connect to Cloudflare's service from an MCP client (e.g. Cursor, Claude) and use natural language to accomplish tasks through your Cloudflare account.\n\nThese MCP servers allow your [MCP Client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) to read configurations from your account, process information, make suggestions based on data, and even make those suggested changes for you. All of these actions can happen across Cloudflare's many services including application development, security and performance.\n\nThe following servers are included in this repository:\n\n| Server

client\n\nIf your MCP client has first class support for remote MCP servers, the client will provide a way to accept the server URL directly within its interface (e.g. [Cloudflare AI Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/))\n\nIf your client does not yet support remote MCP servers, you will need to set up its respective configuration file using mcp-remote (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) to specify which servers your client can access.\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"mcpServers\": {\n\t\t\"cloudflare-observability\": {\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"npx\",\n\t\t\t\"args\": [\"mcp-remote\", \"https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse\"]\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"cloudflare-bindings\": {\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"npx\",\n\t\t\t\"args\": [\"mcp-remote\", \"https://bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse\"]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Using Cloudflare's MCP servers from the OpenAI Responses API\n\nTo use one of Cloudflare's MCP servers with [OpenAI's responses API](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-and-features-in-the-responses-api/), you will need to provide the Responses API with an API token that has the scopes (permissions) required for that particular MCP server.\n\nFor example, to use the [Browser Rendering MCP server](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/tree/main/apps/browser-rendering) with OpenAI, create an API token in the Cloudflare dashboard [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens), with the following permissions:\n\n<img width=\"937\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 10 38 02 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/872e253f-23ce-43b3-983c-45f9d0f66100\" />\n\n## Need access to more Cloudflare tools?\n\nWe're continuing to add more functionality to this remote MCP server repo. If you'd like to leave feedback, file a bug or provide a feature request, [please open an issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/issues/new/choose) on this repository\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n\"Claude's response was interrupted ... \"\n\nIf you see this message, Claude likely hit its context-length limit and stopped mid-reply. This happens most often on servers that trigger many chained tool calls such as the observability server.\n\nTo reduce the chance of running in to this issue:\n\n- Try to be specific, keep your queries concise.\n- If a single request calls multiple tools, try to to break it into several smaller tool calls to keep the responses short.\n\n## Paid Features\n\nSome features may require a paid Cloudflare Workers plan. Ensure your Cloudflare account has the necessary subscription level for the features you intend to use.\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing, and running this server locally?
