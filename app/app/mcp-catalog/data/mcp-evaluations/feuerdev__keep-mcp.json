Add the MCP server to your MCP servers:\n\n```json\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"keep-mcp-pipx\": {\n      \"command\": \"pipx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"keep-mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GOOGLE_EMAIL\": \"Your Google Email\",\n        \"GOOGLE_MASTER_TOKEN\": \"Your Google Master Token - see README.md\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n2. Add your credentials:\n* `GOOGLE_EMAIL`: Your Google account email address\n* `GOOGLE_MASTER_TOKEN`: Your Google account master token\n\nCheck https://gkeepapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#obtaining-a-master-token and https://github.com/simon-weber/gpsoauth?tab=readme-ov-file#alternative-flow for more information.\n\n## Features\n\n* `find`: Search for notes based on a query string\n* `create_note`: Create a new note with title and text (automatically adds keep-mcp label)\n* `update_note`: Update a note's title and text\n* `delete_note`: Mark a note for deletion\n\nBy default, all destructive and modification operations are restricted to notes that have were created by the MCP server (i.e. have the keep-mcp label). Set `UNSAFE_MODE` to `true` to bypass this restriction.\n\n```\n\"env\": {\n  ...\n  \"UNSAFE_MODE\": \"true\"\n}\n```\n\n## Publishing\n\nTo publish a new version to PyPI:\n\n1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`\n2. Build the package:\n   ```bash\n   pipx run build\n   ```\n3. Upload to PyPI:\n   ```bash\n   pipx run twine upload --repository pypi dist/*\n   ```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* If you get \"DeviceManagementRequiredOrSyncDisabled\" check https://admin.google.com/ac/devices/settings/general and turn \"Turn off mobile management (Unmanaged)\"\n",
