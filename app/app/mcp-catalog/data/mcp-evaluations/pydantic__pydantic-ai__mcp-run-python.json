Register a static system prompt using a keyword argument to the agent.\n    # For more complex dynamically-generated system prompts, see the example below.\n    system_prompt='Be concise, reply with one sentence.',\n)\n\n# Run the agent synchronously, conducting a conversation with the LLM.\n# Here the exchange should be very short: Pydantic AI will send the system prompt and the user query to the LLM,\n# the model will return a text response. See below for a more complex run.\nresult = agent.run_sync('Where does \"hello world\" come from?')\nprint(result.output)\n\"\"\"\nThe first known use of \"hello, world\" was in a 1974 textbook about the C programming language.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n_(This example is complete, it can be run \"as is\")_\n\nNot very interesting yet, but we can easily add \"tools\", dynamic system prompts, and structured responses to build more powerful agents.\n\n## Tools & Dependency Injection Example\n\nHere is a concise example using Pydantic AI to build a support agent for a bank:\n\n**(Better documented example [in the docs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/#tools-dependency-injection-example))**\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext\n\nfrom bank_database import DatabaseConn\n\n\n# SupportDependencies is used to pass data, connections, and logic into the model that will be needed when running\n# system prompt and tool functions. Dependency injection provides a type-safe way to customise the behavior of your agents.\n@dataclass\nclass SupportDependencies:\n    customer_id: int\n    db: DatabaseConn\n\n\n# This pydantic model defines the structure of the output returned by the agent.\nclass SupportOutput(BaseModel):\n    support_advice: str = Field(description='Advice returned to the customer')\n    block_card: bool = Field(description=\"Whether to block the customer's card\")\n    risk: int = Field(description='Risk level of query', ge=0, le=10)\n\n\n# This agent will act as first-tier support in a bank.\n# Agents are generic in the type of dependencies they accept and the type of output they return.\n# In this case, the support agent has type `Agent[SupportDependencies, SupportOutput]`.\nsupport_agent = Agent(\n    'openai:gpt-4o',\n    deps_type=SupportDependencies,\n    # The response from the agent will, be guaranteed to be a SupportOutput,\n    # if validation fails the agent is prompted to try again.\n    output_type=SupportOutput,\n    system_prompt=(\n        'You are a support agent in our bank, give the '\n        'customer support and judge the risk level of their query.'\n    ),\n)\n\n\n# Dynamic system prompts can make use of dependency injection.\n# Dependencies are carried via the `RunContext` argument, which is parameterized with the `deps_type` from above.\n# If the type annotation here is wrong, static type checkers will catch it.\n@support_agent.system_prompt\nasync def add_customer_name(ctx: RunContext[SupportDependencies]) -> str:\n    customer_name = await ctx.deps.db.customer_name(id=ctx.deps.customer_id)\n    return f\"The customer's name is {customer_name!r}\"\n\n\n# `tool` let you register functions which the LLM may call while responding to a user.\n# Again, dependencies are carried via `RunContext`, any other arguments become the tool schema passed to the LLM.\n# Pydantic is used to validate these arguments, and errors are passed back to the LLM so it can retry.\n@support_agent.tool\nasync def customer_balance(\n        ctx: RunContext[SupportDependencies], include_pending: bool\n) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Returns the customer's current account balance.\"\"\"\n    # The docstring of a tool is also passed to the LLM as the description of the tool.\n    # Parameter descriptions are extracted from the docstring and added to the parameter schema sent to the LLM.\n    balance = await ctx.deps.db.customer_balance(\n        id=ctx.deps.customer_id,\n        include_pending=include_pending,\n    )\n    return balance\n\n\n...  # In a real use case, you'd add more tools and a longer system prompt\n\n\nasync def main():\n    deps = SupportDependencies(customer_id=123, db=DatabaseConn())\n    # Run the agent asynchronously, conducting a conversation with the LLM until a final response is reached.\n    # Even in this fairly simple case, the agent will exchange multiple messages with the LLM as tools are called to retrieve an output.\n    result = await support_agent.run('What is my balance?', deps=deps)\n    # The `result.output` will be validated with Pydantic to guarantee it is a `SupportOutput`. Since the agent is generic,\n    # it'll also be typed as a `SupportOutput` to aid with static type checking.\n    print(result.output)\n    \"\"\"\n    support_advice='Hello John, your current account balance, including pending transactions, is $123.45.' block_card=False risk=1\n    \"\"\"\n\n    result = await support_agent.run('I just lost my card!', deps=deps)\n    print(result.output)\n    \"\"\"\n    support_advice=\"I'm sorry to hear that, John. We are temporarily blocking your card to prevent unauthorized transactions.\" block_card=True risk=8\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTo try Pydantic AI yourself, follow the instructions [in the examples](https://ai.pydantic.dev/examples/).\n\nRead the [docs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/) to learn more about building applications with Pydantic AI.\n\nRead the [API Reference](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/agent/) to understand Pydantic AI's interface.\n",
