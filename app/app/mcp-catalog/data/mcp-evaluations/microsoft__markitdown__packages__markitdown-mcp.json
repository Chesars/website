See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0:\n> * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install 'markitdown[all]'` to have backward-compatible behavior. \n> * convert\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO.\n> * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. *No temporary files are created anymore*. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything.\n\nMarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption.\n\nMarkItDown currently supports the conversion from:\n\n- PDF\n- PowerPoint\n- Word\n- Excel\n- Images (EXIF metadata and OCR)\n- Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription)\n- HTML\n- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)\n- ZIP files (iterates over contents)\n- Youtube URLs\n- EPubs\n- ... and more!\n\n## Why Markdown?\n\nMarkdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still\nprovides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as\nOpenAI's GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their\nresponses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of\nMarkdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions\nare also highly token-efficient.\n\n## Prerequisites\nMarkItDown requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.\n\nWith the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nIf using `uv`, you can create a virtual environment with:\n\n```bash\nuv venv --python=3.12 .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n# NOTE: Be sure to use 'uv pip install' rather than just 'pip install' to install packages in this virtual environment\n```\n\nIf you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n markitdown python=3.12\nconda activate markitdown\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install 'markitdown[all]'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git\ncd markitdown\npip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command-Line\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md\n```\n\nOr use `-o` to specify the output file:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md\n```\n\nYou can also pipe content:\n\n```bash\ncat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown\n```\n\n### Optional Dependencies\nMarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example:\n\n```bash\npip install 'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]'\n```\n\nwill install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.\n\nAt the moment, the following optional dependencies are available:\n\n* `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies\n* `[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files\n* `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files\n* `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files\n* `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files\n* `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files\n* `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages\n* `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence\n* `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files\n* `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription\n\n### Plugins\n\nMarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown --list-plugins\n```\n\nTo enable plugins use:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf\n```\n\nTo find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`.\n\n### Azure Document Intelligence\n\nTo use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e \"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\"\n```\n\nMore information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)\n\n### Python API\n\nBasic usage in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\n\nmd = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins\nresult = md.convert(\"test.xlsx\")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\nDocument Intelligence conversion in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\n\nmd = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=\"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\")\nresult = md.convert(\"test.pdf\")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\nTo use Large Language Models for image descriptions, provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\nmd = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=\"gpt-4o\")\nresult = md.convert(\"example.jpg\")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n```sh\ndocker build -t markitdown:latest .\ndocker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
