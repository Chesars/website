  "readme": "# mcp-stockfish üêü\n\nA Model Context Protocol server that lets your AI talk to Stockfish. Because apparently we needed to make chess engines even more accessible to our silicon overlords.\n\n![Claude Desktop with mcp-stockfish](claude.png)\n\n> üß†‚ö°üñ•Ô∏è *Your LLM thinks, Stockfish calculates, you pretend you understand the resulting 15-move tactical sequence.*\n\n## What is this?\n\nThis creates a bridge between AI systems and the Stockfish chess engine via the MCP protocol. It handles multiple concurrent sessions because your AI probably wants to analyze seventeen positions simultaneously while you're still figuring out why your knight is hanging.\n\nBuilt on [mark3labs/mcp-go](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go). Because reinventing wheels is for people with too much time.\n\n## Features\n\n- **üîÑ Concurrent Sessions**: Run multiple Stockfish instances without your CPU crying\n- **‚ö° Full UCI Support**: All the commands you need, none of the ones you don't\n- **üéØ Actually Works**: Unlike your last side project, this one has proper error handling\n- **üìä JSON Everything**: Because apparently we can't just use plain text anymore\n- **üê≥ Docker Ready**: Containerized for when you inevitably break your local setup\n\n## Supported UCI Commands ‚ôüÔ∏è\n\n| **Command**          | **Description**                                                                |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `uci`                | Initializes the engine in UCI mode                                            |\n| `isready`            | Checks if the engine is ready. Returns `readyok`                              |\n| `position startpos`  | Sets up the board to the starting position                                    |\n| `position fen [FEN]` | Sets up a position using FEN notation                                         |\n| `go`                 | Starts the engine to compute the best move                                    |\n| `go depth [n]`       | Searches `n` plies deep. Example: `go depth 10`                                |\n| `go movetime [ms]`   | Thinks for a fixed amount of time in milliseconds. Example: `go movetime 1000` |\n| `stop`               | Stops current search                                                          |\n| `quit`               | Closes the session                                                            |\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/sonirico/mcp-stockfish\ncd mcp-stockfish\nmake install\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\n# Default mode (stdio, because we're old school)\nmcp-stockfish\n\n# With custom Stockfish path (for the special snowflakes)\nMCP_STOCKFISH_PATH=/your/special/stockfish mcp-stockfish\n\n# HTTP mode (for the web-scale crowd)\nMCP_STOCKFISH_SERVER_MODE=http mcp-stockfish\n```\n\n## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n#### Server Configuration\n\n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_SERVER_MODE`: \"stdio\" or \"http\" (default: \"stdio\")\n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_HTTP_HOST`: HTTP host (default: \"localhost\") \n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_HTTP_PORT`: HTTP port (default: 8080)\n\n#### Stockfish üêü Configuration\n\n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_PATH`: Path to Stockfish binary (default: \"stockfish\")\n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_MAX_SESSIONS`: Max concurrent sessions (default: 10)\n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_SESSION_TIMEOUT`: Session timeout (default: \"30m\")\n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_COMMAND_TIMEOUT`: Command timeout (default: \"30s\")\n\n#### Logging\n\n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_LOG_LEVEL`: debug, info, warn, error, fatal\n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_LOG_FORMAT`: json, console  \n- `MCP_STOCKFISH_LOG_OUTPUT`: stdout, stderr\n\n## Tool Parameters\n\n- `command`: UCI command to execute\n- `session_id`: Session ID (optional, we'll make one up if you don't)\n\n## Response Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success|error\", \n  \"session_id\": \"some-uuid\",\n  \"command\": \"what you asked for\",\n  \"response\": [\"what stockfish said\"],\n  \"error\": \"what went wrong (if anything)\"\n}\n```\n\n## Session Management\n\nSessions do what you'd expect:\n\n- Spawn Stockfish processes on demand\n- Keep UCI state between commands  \n- Clean up when you're done (or when they timeout)\n- Enforce limits so you don't fork-bomb yourself\n\n## Integration\n\n### Claude Desktop\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chess\": {\n      \"command\": \"mcp-stockfish\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"MCP_STOCKFISH_LOG_LEVEL\": \"info\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\nmake deps     # Get dependencies\nmake build    # Build the thing\nmake test     # Run tests (when they exist)\nmake fmt      # Make it pretty\n```\n\n## Credits üêü\n\nPowered by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/), the chess engine that's stronger than both of us combined.
