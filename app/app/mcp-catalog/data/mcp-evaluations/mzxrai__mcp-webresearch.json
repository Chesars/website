  "readme": "# MCP Web Research Server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for web research. \n\nBring real-time info into Claude and easily research any topic.\n\n## Features\n\n- Google search integration\n- Webpage content extraction\n- Research session tracking (list of visited pages, search queries, etc.)\n- Screenshot capture\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18 (includes `npm` and `npx`)\n- [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download)\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, ensure you've downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have npm installed.\n\nNext, add this entry to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (on Mac, found at `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"webresearch\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@mzxrai/mcp-webresearch@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis config allows Claude Desktop to automatically start the web research MCP server when needed.\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply start a chat with Claude and send a prompt that would benefit from web research. If you'd like a prebuilt prompt customized for deeper web research, you can use the `agentic-research` prompt that we provide through this package. Access that prompt in Claude Desktop by clicking the Paperclip icon in the chat input and then selecting `Choose an integration` → `webresearch` → `agentic-research`.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/N6Y3C0q/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-11-01-27-PM.png\" alt=\"Example screenshot of web research\" width=\"400\"/>\n\n### Tools\n\n1. `search_google`\n   - Performs Google searches and extracts results\n   - Arguments: `{ query: string }`\n\n2. `visit_page`\n   - Visits a webpage and extracts its content\n   - Arguments: `{ url: string, takeScreenshot?: boolean }`\n\n3. `take_screenshot`\n   - Takes a screenshot of the current page\n   - No arguments required\n\n### Prompts\n\n#### `agentic-research`\nA guided research prompt that helps Claude conduct thorough web research. The prompt instructs Claude to:\n- Start with broad searches to understand the topic landscape\n- Prioritize high-quality, authoritative sources\n- Iteratively refine the research direction based on findings\n- Keep you informed and let you guide the research interactively\n- Always cite sources with URLs\n\n### Resources\n\nWe expose two things as MCP resources: (1) captured webpage screenshots, and (2) the research session.\n\n#### Screenshots\n\nWhen you take a screenshot, it's saved as an MCP resource. You can access captured screenshots in Claude Desktop via the Paperclip icon.\n\n#### Research Session\n\nThe server maintains a research session that includes:\n- Search queries\n- Visited pages\n- Extracted content\n- Screenshots\n- Timestamps\n\n### Suggestions\n\nFor the best results, if you choose not to use the `agentic-research` prompt when doing your research, it may be helpful to suggest high-quality sources for Claude to use when researching general topics. For example, you could prompt `news today from reuters or AP` instead of `news today`.\n\n## Problems\n\nThis is very much pre-alpha code. And it is also AIGC, so expect bugs.\n\nIf you run into issues, it may be helpful to check Claude Desktop's MCP logs:\n\n```bash\ntail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log\n```\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\npnpm install\n\n# Build the project\npnpm build\n\n# Watch for changes\npnpm watch\n\n# Run in development mode\npnpm dev\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js >= 18\n- Playwright (automatically installed as a dependency)\n\n## Verified Platforms\n\n- [x] macOS\n- [ ] Linux\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Author\n\n[mzxrai](https://github.com/mzxrai) ",
