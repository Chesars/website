# MCP Catalog - Discover the Best Model Context Protocol Servers

Welcome to the **MCP Catalog**, your comprehensive guide to the Model Context Protocol ecosystem! üöÄ

## What is the MCP Catalog?

The MCP Catalog is an open-source, community-driven directory that helps developers discover, evaluate, and choose the best MCP servers for their AI applications. With the explosion of MCP servers in the ecosystem, we recognized the need for a curated platform that highlights quality, reliability, and innovation.

### Why We Built This

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Not all MCP servers are created equal. We evaluate each server based on code quality, documentation, community support, and protocol implementation.
- **Save Time**: Stop scrolling through endless GitHub repos. Find the right MCP server for your needs quickly.
- **Community-Driven**: Built by the community, for the community. Anyone can contribute!
- **Transparency**: Our scoring algorithm is open-source and clearly documented.

## üèÜ MCP Quality Score

Each MCP server is evaluated on a 100-point scale across five key dimensions:

### 1. MCP Protocol Implementation (60 points)
- Core MCP features: tools, prompts, resources, sampling, roots, logging
- Transport protocols: STDIO and HTTP support
- Authentication: OAuth2 implementation
- *Currently, all servers receive full points as we develop automated testing*

### 2. GitHub Community Health (20 points)
- **Stars** (10 pts): Popularity and community trust
  - 1000+ stars = 10 pts
  - 501-1000 stars = 8 pts
  - 101-500 stars = 6 pts
  - 51-100 stars = 4 pts
  - 11-50 stars = 2 pts
- **Contributors** (6 pts): Community engagement
  - 10+ contributors = 6 pts
  - 4-10 contributors = 4 pts
  - 2-3 contributors = 2 pts
- **Issues** (4 pts): Development activity
  - 20+ issues = 4 pts
  - 6-20 issues = 2 pts

### 3. Development Maturity (10 points)
- CI/CD pipeline presence (5 pts)
- Published releases (5 pts)

### 4. Documentation Quality (8 points)
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Usage examples and API documentation

### 5. Badge Adoption (2 points)
- Display of MCP Quality badge in README

## üéØ Features

- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by category, programming language, or search across all fields
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically scraped GitHub data including latest commits
- **Quality Badges**: Add our badge to your README to showcase your score
- **Detailed Views**: Deep dive into each server with full README, metrics, and configuration
- **Open Source**: Everything is transparent and contributable

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

The MCP Catalog is built with:

- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **GitHub API**: Real-time repository data
- **Automated Scraping**: Regular updates via `scrape-github.ts`

### Key Components

- `page.tsx`: Main catalog page with filtering
- `[slug]/page.tsx`: Detailed server view
- `client.tsx`: Client-side filtering and search
- `quality-calculator.ts`: Scoring algorithm
- `scrape-github.ts`: GitHub data fetcher

## üìä Data Structure

Each MCP server is stored with comprehensive metadata:

```typescript
interface MCPServer {
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  category: string | null;
  qualityScore: number | null;
  gitHubOrg: string;
  gitHubRepo: string;
  repositoryPath?: string | null;
  programmingLanguage: string;
  // GitHub metrics
  gh_stars: number;
  gh_contributors: number;
  gh_issues: number;
  gh_releases: boolean;
  gh_ci_cd: boolean;
  gh_latest_commit_hash?: string;
  last_scraped_at?: string;
  // MCP features
  implementing_tools: boolean;
  implementing_prompts: boolean;
  implementing_resources: boolean;
  // ... and more
}
```

## üöÄ Running Locally
